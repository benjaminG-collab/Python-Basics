# Python-Basics
This repository is a collection of my Python learning projects and practice exercises. I’m building a foundation in programming as I connect recruitment and tech.

What’s inside

Simple Python scripts (loops, functions, conditionals)

Beginner projects (calculators, text-based programs, randomization)

Notes on key concepts (variables, lists, dictionaries, error handling)

Recruitment-focused mini scripts (string parsing, basic automation ideas)

Goal

To strengthen my programming fundamentals so I can:

Experiment with AI prompting + Python integrations

Lay the groundwork for advanced projects in AI + HR Tech
